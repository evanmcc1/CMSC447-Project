## FIRST RESPONDER MISSION MANAGEMENT

### Situation:

Hurricane season can bring devastating storms to the US and create chaotic situations for first responders and NGOs to manage the humanitarian aid efforts.

In Sept 2017, after 12 years of no major hurricanes in the US, Texas was hit by a major category 3, evolving into a category 4, hurricane named Harvey, with sustained winds up to 130 mph. In two days, much of Texas received between 30 and 60 inches of rain (more than 27 trillion gallons), impacting over 300,000 structures, and involving the rescue of more than 10,000 people. The storm surged to levels of 4 to 7 feet above ground level.

The local community struggled to manage the calls for assistance and the management of responders to assist. The first responder community had to expand and leverage not only the local units, but units from surrounding areas, adjoining states, federal government, NGOs and volunteer organizations. Coordination was needed with public utility companies for electricity and gas, water management, sewage management, and waste management.

Teams had to leverage various kinds of equipment and skills ranging from specialized divers, boats both large and small, military large-scale equipment, helicopters, etc. to assist the able, elderly, immobile, handicap, young, and their pets. There existed individuals in the community who leveraged social media to collect and communicate with first responders and volunteers due to the lack of sophisticated systems by the first responders.

### Need

Software to provide the communication and coordination of incoming calls for assistance (called “events”) with the proper organizations, personnel, and equipment to resolve.

A central call center will be staffed to receive phone calls and text messages from those in need. There is also an interest in other modes of communication. The first responders need to see where the calls are located (map), what kind of service is needed (such as person/pet stuck on roof, electrical line down, handicap person stranded on first floor), urgency of situation, what time the call came in, etc.

Based on the needs, a first responder operations chief will assemble the calls for service into groupings to be addressed, which they call a “mission”. The operations chief will filter the calls into the appropriate groupings. Available and appropriate equipment and personnel will be assigned to the mission. Missions need to be tracked through to completion with information about each event and resolution information. Missions may change real-time based on current conditions in the field.

The mission management team needs to maintain situation awareness at all times and actively manage events and missions, both real-time and retrospectively.
